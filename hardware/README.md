# IcosaLEDron 3D printed parts

Remixed from the fantastic [Snap-together Icosahedron (d20)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2778943) by [aveday\_](https://www.thingiverse.com/aveday_)

Parts:

I printed all parts at high speed, 0.2mm layer height, no brim or raft.

The triangular frame parts can all be printed without supports:

- 17 x [IcosaLEDron-FeatherWing-Triangle-w-Screw-Holes.stl](IcosaLEDron-FeatherWing-Triangle-w-Screw-Holes.stl)
- 1 x [IcosaLEDron-FeatherWing-Triangle-w-Switch-Holder.stl](IcosaLEDron-FeatherWing-Triangle-w-Switch-Holder.stl)
- 1 x [IcosaLEDron-FeatherWing-Triangle-w-Feather-USB-Holder.stl](IcosaLEDron-FeatherWing-Triangle-w-Feather-USB-Holder.stl)
- 1 x [IcosaLEDron-FeatherWing-Triangle-w-Feather-End-Holder.stl](IcosaLEDron-FeatherWing-Triangle-w-Feather-End-Holder.stl)

I did have to enable supports, touching build plate only, for the dome covers:
